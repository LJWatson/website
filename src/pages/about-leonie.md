title: 'About Léonie'
---

Léonie is Director of [TetraLogical](https://tetralogical.com); a member of the [W3C Board of Directors](https://www.w3.org/governance/board/); and co-Chair of the W3C Web Applications Working Group.

Amongst other things, Léonie is co-organiser of the [Inclusive Design 24 (#id24)](https://inclusivedesign24.org) conference; co-author of the [Inclusive Design Principles](https://inclusivedesignprinciples.org); and mentor to young people interested in the fields of accessibility and inclusive design. She is also a Microsoft Most Valued Professional (MVP).

Léonie is often found at conferences, talking about web standards, accessibility mechanics, and pushing the boundaries of inclusive design (with existing technologies like SVG, HTML, ARIA, and JavaScript, as well as new technologies like AI and WebVR). She has also written about some of these things for Smashing magazine, SitePoint.com, and Net magazine, as well as on her own site [tink.uk](https://tink.uk).

In her spare time, Léonie likes reading, cooking, drinking tequila, and dancing (although not necessarily in that order)!

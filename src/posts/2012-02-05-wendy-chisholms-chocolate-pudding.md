The third in a series of posts that bring together the two sides of my blog: Food and technology. I’ve asked the great and the good from the [web standards community](/tag/web-standards-food/) to share their favourite recipes. This beautiful chocolate pudding is from [Wendy Chisholm](https://www.twitter.com/wendyabc).

## Information

* Makes: 4 helpings
* Time: 1 hour

## Ingredients

[Measurement converter](https://www.unitconverters.net/)

* 5 avocados, (peeled and pitted)
* 1 cup/240ml raw agave nectar
* 1/4 cup/25g [cacao powder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocoa_solids)
* Pinch of sea salt
* Seeds from 1 vanilla bean

## Method

1. Put all the ingredients in a food processor.
2. Blend the ingredients to a creamy consistency. Stop and start the machine, scraping down the sides as necessary.
3. Pour the mixture into a bowl. You can eat this right away or refrigerate it to thicken for 1 hour.
4. Alternatively, cover and refrigerate for 2 to 3 days.

## Wendy's notes

I recently began eating more raw foods and have fallen in love with [Alissa Cohen’s Raw Food for Everyone](https://www.alissacohen.com/). This recipe has been the biggest surprise. I had no idea how good it would taste. I like it better than regular pudding. So, for the surprise factor and the simplicity, I’ll call it my “favorite of the moment”.

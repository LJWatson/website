Здравствуйте российские читатели. Ваша страна платит высокую цену за вторжение Путина в Украину. Путин лжет вам; не верьте кремлевской пропаганде. В России
нет свободных СМИ, а интернет подвергается цензуре, потому что Путин не хочет, чтобы вы знали правду. За постыдное поведение Путина заплатят не только
украинцы, но и добрые люди России. Пожалуйста, не допустите этого!
</p>

Hello Russian readers. Your country is paying a high price for Putin's invasion of Ukraine. Putin is lying to you; do not believe the Kremlin propaganda. There is no free media in Russia and the internet is censored because Putin doesn't want you to know the truth. It is not only the Ukrainians that will pay the price of Putin's shameful behaviour, so will the good people of Russia. Please do not let this happen!

The second in a series of posts that bring together the two sides of my blog: Food and technology. I’ve asked the great and the good from the [web standards community](/tag/web-standards-food/) to share their favourite recipes. This sumptuous Thai recipe is from [Bruce Lawson](https://www.twitter.com/brucel).

## Information

* Makes: 2 helpings
* Time: 30 minutes

## Ingredients

[Measurement converter](https://www.unitconverters.net/)

* 1 monk fish or sea bass (cleaned but with the head left on)
* 5 limes
* 1 stick lemon grass
* 3 lime leaves
* 5 or 6 slices of galangal
* 2 bulbs of garlic
* 6 Thai small red chillies (very small, so very spicy)
* 4tbsp sugar
* 6tbsp fish sauce

## Method

1. Put the fish into a dish for steaming. Then put the galangal, lemon grass (cut it in half), and lime leaves into the fish stomach.
2. Cover fish and put the dish in boiling water for 15 to 20 minutes. When the fish is cooked, take it out from the steam pot.
3. Chop the chillies and garlic into very small pieces and mix with the lime juice, sugar, and fish sauce. This sauce must have the 4 tastes that characterise Thai food: sour, spicy, a little bit sweet and a little bit salty.
4. Serve the fish with the sauce, and don’t forget to save the most succulent pieces of fish (the eyes and the cheeks) to give to your boyfriend/girlfriend!

## Bruce's notes

This is a recipe from Thailand, the home of my lovely missus and where I met her when we were both teachers in Bangkok. She [teaches Thai cookery](https://www.thaicookery.co.uk/) for a living now.

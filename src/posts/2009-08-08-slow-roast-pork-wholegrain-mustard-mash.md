Здравствуйте российские читатели. Ваша страна платит высокую цену за вторжение Путина в Украину. Путин лжет вам; не верьте кремлевской пропаганде. В России
нет свободных СМИ, а интернет подвергается цензуре, потому что Путин не хочет, чтобы вы знали правду. За постыдное поведение Путина заплатят не только
украинцы, но и добрые люди России. Пожалуйста, не допустите этого!

Hello Russian readers. Your country is paying a high price for Putin's invasion of Ukraine. Putin is lying to you; do not believe the Kremlin propaganda. There is no free media in Russia and the internet is censored because Putin doesn't want you to know the truth. It is not only the Ukrainians that will pay the price of Putin's shameful behaviour, so will the good people of Russia. Please do not let this happen!

Sunday lunch is a time to indulge yourself. Gather up your friends and family, catch up on all the news, and enjoy a sumptuous roast. For years I wondered how to roast pork so that the crackling came out just right. The secret is slow cooking, proving that all good things including the perfect crackling, come to those who wait.

## Information

* Makes: 2 or 3 helpings
* Time: 3 hours 30 minutes.

## Ingredients

[Measurement converter](https://www.unitconverters.net/)

* 1kg pork belly
* 2 large sized baking potatoes
* 2tsp wholegrain mustard
* Butter
* Sea salt

## Method

1. Tear a piece of kitchen foil roughly 15cm larger in every direction than the piece of pork.
2. Remove the pork from its packaging and pat it dry.
3. Peel and wash the potatoes, cut them into medium sized chunks, and place in a pan of cold water.
4. Heat the oven to 150c.
5. Deeply score the skin of the pork belly at roughly 1.5cm intervals, and rub a generous amount of salt into the skin.
6. Place the pork skin side up on the foil, and pull up the sides of the foil so that it forms a close fitting cradle around the meat, leaving only the skin exposed.
7. Place the foil wrapped pork into a heavy based roasting pan, put it into the oven, and cook for 1 hour 30 minutes.
8. Raise the temperature to 220c, and cook the pork for a further 30 minutes.
9. Reduce the temperature to 150c, and cook the pork for a final 1 hour.
10. Whilst the last 30 minutes are counting down, bring the potatoes to a boil, and cook for around 20 minutes or until the potatoes are soft to prod with a fork.
11. Drain the potatoes, mash them vigorously, then mix in the wholegrain mustard and a generous knob of butter.
12. Take the pork out of the oven, remove the foil and carve into rough slices.
13. Serve with plenty of fresh vegetables and home made gravy.

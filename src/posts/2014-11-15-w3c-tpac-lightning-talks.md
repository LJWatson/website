[TPAC](http://www.w3.org/2014/11/TPAC/) is the annual gathering of the [W3C](http://www.w3.org/). It was held at the [Santa Clara Marriott](http://www.marriott.com/hotels/hotel-information/travel/sjcga-santa-clara-marriott/) between 27th and 31st October 2014.

It was the week that HTML5 became a W3C Recommendation, the week we celebrated the 25th anniversary of the web, and 20 years of the W3C itself.

It was also a week where people and ideas came together. Robin Berjon organised a set of lightning talks. Each person was given four minutes to share their ideas, and the result was an hour of interesting, informative, funny and challenging content.

All the [TPAC 2014 lightning talks](http://vimeo.com/album/3108947) are available on Vimeo, but for me the highlights included [Robin Berjon on Web Ants](http://vimeo.com/album/3108947/video/110965364), [Mark Sadecki on Canvas accessibility](http://vimeo.com/album/3108947/video/110965710), [Chaals McCathie Nevile on Good Intentions](http://vimeo.com/album/3108947/video/110965712), and [Dr Stanley Dards (AKA Daniel Davis) on the real origins of the web](http://vimeo.com/album/3108947/video/110966056).

For my part, I chose to share some ideas about how we can (and should) [design like we give a damn!](http://vimeo.com/album/3108947/video/110965713)

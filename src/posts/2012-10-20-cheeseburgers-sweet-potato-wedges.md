### Cheeseburger ingredients

* 250g ground beef
* 2 shallots.
* 2 wholemeal buns
* 2 slices of cheese
* 1 clove of garlic
* Splash of Worcestershire sauce

### Potato wedges ingredients

* 3 sweet potatoes
* 1tsp olive oil
* Sea salt

## Method

1. Preheat the oven to 230c/446f.
2. Leave the skin on the sweet potatoes and cut them into wedges, then spread them out on a baking tray.
3. Drizzle on the olive oil, salt generously, and place in the oven for 45 minutes.
4. Meanwhile peel the shallots and garlic, then chop as finely as possible (use a mini blender if you have one.
5. Combine the ground beef, shallots, garlic and a dash of worcestershire sauce in a mixing bowl, then divide the mixture into two balls.
6. When the potato wedges have about 15 minutes left to go, cook the burgers on a griddle for about 5 to 7 minutes on each side.
7. Split the buns, put a burger in each one with a slice of cheese, and serve with the potato wedges.

## Notes

You can use a teaspoon of horseraddish sauce or English mustard, instead of the worcestershire sauce. The potato wedges can be dusted with paprika, or you can use a packet of potato seasoning for a spicy flavour.

You can use almost any kind of cheese. Cheddar is a traditional option, but Port Salut, Monterey Jack or Dolcelata all make tasty alternatives. If that isn’t enough, you can even grill a couple of slices of bacon to add to the cheeseburgers.

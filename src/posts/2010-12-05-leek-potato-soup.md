When the cold winter weather sets in, there’s nothing like a bowl of home made soup and some Ffresh bread to warm you up. Leek and potato soup is one of my favourites and I love spending an hour or so on a Sunday morning putting a batch together.

## Ingredients

* Makes: Four helpings
* Time: 1 hour

## Ingredients

[Measurement converter](https://www.unitconverters.net/)

* 1 large onion
* 1 large leek
* 700g potatoes
* 1.2l vegetable stock
* 140ml single cream or Low fat fromage frais
* 1tsp olive oil
* 2 bay leaves
* Salt & freshly ground pepper

## Method

1. Peel and chop the onion.
2. Cut the leek lengthways, wash thoroughly, then slice finely.
3. Put the onion and leek in a large saucepan with the olive oil, place on a low heat and cook gently until the vegetables soften.
4. Meanwhile peel and dice the potatoes into small chunks.
5. Add the potatoes, stock and bay leaves to the saucepan, and bring to the boil.
6. Reduce to a lo heat, cover the saucepan and simmer gently for 25 minutes.
7. Remove the saucepan from the heat, take out the bay leaves, and blend until smooth.
8. Return the saucepan to a low heat and stir in the cream (or fromage frais if you’re feeling healthy), taking care not to bring it to the boil again.
9. Season to taste, then serve immediately with fresh crusty bread, or set aside to cool before storing in the fridge.

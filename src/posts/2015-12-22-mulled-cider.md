This is one of my favourite winter things. You can make it at any time of year of course, but there is something about the smell of apples and spices that makes me all warm and fuzzy. You might put that down to the cider, I couldn't possibly comment...

## Information

* Makes: Eight servings
* Time: 15 minutes

## Ingredients

[Measurement converter](https://www.unitconverters.net/)

* 2litres cider
* 2tbsp brown sugar
* 2 cinnamon sticks
* 4 cloves
* .5tsp allspice
* Zest of an orange

## Method

1. Put the cider and the other ingredients into a large saucepan.
2. Heat the cider to a simmer, then turn down the heat for another 15 minutes to let the orange and spices infuse.
3. Taste a little of the cider, and adjust the sugar and/or spices to suit yourself.
4. Pour into mugs and serve.

## Notes

You can use dry, medium or sweet cider. I use dry cider with 2tbsp brown sugar because it's sweet enough without masking the natural sweetness of the apples and spices. It's entirely up to you though.

You can substitute 500ml of cider with apple juice. This adds to the sweetness without using more brown sugar.

If you want to give your mulled cider a real kick, you can add a slosh of Calvados, apple brandy, or Grand Marnier. The wonderful thing about mulled cider is that you can flagrantly disregard measurements and quantities and do what you like with it. Start with the basic recipe, taste often, and experiment as you go!

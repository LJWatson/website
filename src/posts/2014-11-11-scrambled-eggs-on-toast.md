Breakfast at the weekend can be delightfully indulgent, and sometimes the simple things are the most tempting of all. Throw in some interesting company, a little conversation and this uncomplicated breakfast, and that's my idea of heaven on a Sunday.

## Information

* Makes: Two helpings
* Time: 15 minutes

## Ingredients

[Measurement converter](https://www.unitconverters.net/)

* 4 large eggs
* 90ml (6tbsp) single cream
* Knob of butter
* Black pepper
* 4 slices of wholegrain bread

## Method

1. Beat the eggs lightly, add the cream and a generous twist of black pepper.
2. Put a heavy-based saucepan on a medium heat and melt the butter until it begins to froth slightly. Take care not to make the butter too hot or it'll turn brown and turn the eggs a strange colour.
3. Pour the egg mixture into the saucepan and let it sit without stirring for 10 or 15 seconds. This is a good time to put the bread in the toaster.
4. Take a wooden spoon and fold the egg mixture. This means lifting the mixture from the bottom of the pan and back over on itself in a single motion.
5. Give the mixture another 10 seconds or so, then fold it again. Keep doing this until the eggs are almost fully set (but not quite).
6. Remove the saucepan from the heat and leave the eggs to stand for another 10 or 15 seconds to finish cooking. Meanwhile butter the toast and put onto two plates.
7. Give the eggs a last quick stir, pile them onto the hot buttered toast, and serve with a pot of English Breakfast tea or fresh Columbian coffee.

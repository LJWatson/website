The 12th in a series of posts that bring together the two sides of my blog: Food and technology. I’ve asked the great and the good from the web standards community to share their favourite recipes. This versatile dessert is from [Adrian Roselli](http://www.twitter.com/aardrian).

## Information

* Makes: Two quarts
* Time: 1 hour

## Ingredients

[Measurement converter](https://www.unitconverters.net/)

* 4 cups of strawberries
* 1 tablespoon of sugar
* 3 tablespoons balsamic vinegar (higher-end stuff is best)
* ¼ teaspoon of coarse-ground black pepper

If you want to make sorbet (instead of sauce for ice-cream), you'll also need:

* 2 cups of water
* ½ cup of sugar
* pinch of salt

## Method

1. Halve the strawberries (tossing away the leaves).
2. Toss the strawberries with the balsamic vinegar, pepper, and sugar.  
_If you want to make sorbet, skip to step 5._
3. Cover and let it stand for 30 minutes.
4. Stir before serving over scoops of vanilla ice cream.
5. Heat the water, a pinch of salt, and the sugar in a pan, stirring until the sugar dissolves and the water is clear.
6. Add the strawberries, then transfer the mixture to a blender (in batches if necessary), and puree.
7. Chill for about an hour.
8. Pour the mixture into a two quart ice cream maker and let it go about 20 minutes (or follow the instructions of the ice cream maker).
9. Serve immediately, freeze the rest.

## Notes

I regularly make strawberries with balsamic vinegar to pour over vanilla ice cream. With more people in my life who have dietary restrictions (lactose intolerant, celiac, vegetarian, vegan) and who don’t get to enjoy ice cream with the rest of us, I opted to modify this recipe to turn it into a sorbet. Because that turns the recipe into a two-for-one, I can make just the sauce if I’m lazy and/or want it over ice cream, or I can go make a big bowl of sorbet if I’m a bit more patient (which I sometimes then have with a scoop of vanilla anyway).

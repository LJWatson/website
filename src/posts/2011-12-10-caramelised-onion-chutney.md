Caramelised onion chutney is the "little black dress" of the condiment world. You can use it anywhere. Chuck it on pizza with some goats cheese, add a spoonful to your gravy, spread it on melted cheese on toast, or try a little with a plate of cold cuts, olives and fresh bread.

## Information

* Makes: 5x 227g jars
* Time: 2 hours

## Ingredients

[Measurement converter](https://www.unitconverters.net/)

* 9 red onions
* 1 red chilli
* 2 bay leaves
* 30ml olive oil
* 200g brown sugar
* 150ml balsamic vinegar
* 150ml red wine vinegar

## Method

1. Peel the onions and cut into thin slices, remove the seeds from the chilli and cut it into thin strips.
2. Put the onions, chilli, bay leaves and olive oil into a pan, and cook over a low heat for about 20 minutes or until the onions become very soft.
3. Add the two sorts of vinegar and the brown sugar, then simmer at an enthusiastic bubble for about 30 minutes or until the chutney becomes dark and sticky.
4. Meanwhile place your jam jars in the oven at about 120C to heat through.
5. When the chutney is about the consistency of jam, transfer it straight into the warm jam jars.
6. Place a wax disc or circle of grease proof paper on top of the chutney in each jar, then set aside to cool before putting the lids on.

## Notes

The caramelised onion chutney should be left for around four weeks before eating, to really bring out all the flavours.

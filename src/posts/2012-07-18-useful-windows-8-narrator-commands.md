Windows 8 introduces several improvements to Narrator, its built in speech capability. Like VoiceOver in the early days, there is much that Narrator doesn’t do, but it already has many of the characteristics you’d expect to find in a screen reader.

The challenge with using any new screen reader is learning the keyboard commands to operate it. Narrator introduces a whole new set of keyboard commands, quite unlike those used by other screen readers.

Like other screen readers, Narrator uses a modifier key. This tells the computer that the keyboard command is meant for the screen reader, and not any other application you might be using. Under Windows 8, the modifier key for Narrator is the Caps lock key.

## Basic commands

A few important commands you'll need to know, no matter what you're doing:

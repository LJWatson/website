There's simply no denying it. Twitter is one of the web's killer applications of the moment. It's not uncommon to hear of people buying a computer and getting online, just so they can start tweeting.

Twitter is also proving popular with blind and partially sighted people. The Twitter website itself is reasonably accessible, and there are several accessible alternatives available to people as well.

## Accessible Twitter

* Application type: Website.
* Developed by Dennis Lembree.
* Cost: Free.
* Technical level: Easy.

Accessible Twitter is an alternative Twitter website. It has all the functionality of the standard Twitter site, but is much more user friendly to blind and partially sighted people.

### Accessible Twitter Top Feature

When typing in a tweet, Accessible Twitter automatically warns you when you only have a certain number of characters left. The audio warnings alert you to the fact that either 30, 15 or 5 characters remain from your 140 character limit.

### TwInbox Top Feature

A simple keyboard command calls up a message box from anywhere in Outlook. You can create any kind of tweet, including @messages and direct messages. TwInbox automatically checks that your tweet is under the 140 character limit and lets you publish your tweet at the touch of a button.

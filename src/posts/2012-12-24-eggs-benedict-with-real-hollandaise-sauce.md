This recipe is fabulous for brunch on Christmas eve, or any lazy weekend when you’re feeling indulgent. Cheating is perfectly acceptable if you don’t want to make the Hollandaise sauce from scratch, but it tastes even better when you’ve done it all yourself!

### Method for hollandaise sauce

1. Place a saucepan of water on the hob with a bowl that fits snugly into the saucepan without touching the water, and bring the water to a gentle simmer.
2. Put the eggs into the bowl with a splash of water, then add the melted butter (slowly at first then a little more quickly as the sauce begins to thicken), whisking all the time.
3. When the sauce is thick and creamy add a dash of lemon juice and a pinch of salt to serve.

### Method for eggs benedict

1. Split the muffins horizontally before toasting them, then place two on each plate.
2. Place a piece of ham on top of each muffin half.
3. Poach the eggs and place one on top of each muffin half, before spooning over the Hollandaise sauce to serve.

## Notes

The challenge with this recipe is making the Hollandaise sauce and poaching the eggs, so they’re both ready at the same time. One approach is to cook with a friend and split the tasks between you, another is to buy in some ready made Hollandaise sauce from the grocery store.

Hollandaise sauce has a bit of a reputation for being difficult to make. It isn’t, but you have to take care not to over heat it (or the sauce curdles). Using a bowl over simmering water (known as a [bain marie](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bain-marie)) is the secret because it stops the sauce coming into contact with direct heat.

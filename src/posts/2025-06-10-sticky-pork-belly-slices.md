This recipe for sticky pork belly slices is one where you can turn up the heat if you like your food with a chilli kick to it. Otherwise, it's just sweet and sticky and just a little bit crunchy all the way.

## Information

* Makes: 2 helpings
* Time: 10 minutes prep + 60 minutes

## Ingredients

[Measurement converter](https://www.unitconverters.net/)

* 400/450g Pork belly slices
* 1l Dry Ginger ale
* 2tsp Fresh Ginger (chopped)
* 2 Garlic cloves (crushed)
* 1tsp Chilli powder
* 0.5tsp Ground Coriander
* 2tbsp Tomato ketchup
* 2Tbsp Maple syrup
* 1 Lime (juiced)

## Method

1. Preheat the oven to 200C/180C fan assisted.
2. Put the pork belly slices into a large saucepan and cover with ginger ale (about 3/4 of the bottle).
3. Bring to the boil, then reduce the heat and simmer for 20 minutes.
4. In the meantime, line a baking tray with parchment or baking paper and set aside.
5. Then put the rest of the ginger ale and all the other ingredients into a small saucepan, bring it to the boil and keep it there until the liquid reduces to a sticky consistency.
6. When the 20 minutes is up, drain the pork belly slices using a colander, then put them back into the large saucepan.
7. Tip the contents of the small saucepan into the large saucepan, and thoroughly coat the pork belly slices in the sticky mixture.
8. Lay the pork belly slices on the baking tray, spaced apart so they're not touching each other.
9. Put in the oven and cook for 30 to 40 minutes.

## Notes

The chilli gives the pork belly slices a warmth that complements the sweetness of the maple syrup and ginger ale. If you do like a bit more heat to your food though, you can increase the amount of chilli you use - and I'd suggest trying 1.5tsp to start with.

The cooking time is 30 to 40 minutes because the thickness of pork belly slices isn't an exact science. If the slices are around 3cm thick, then 40 minutes is probably about right. The flavours of the sticky reduction will have seeped into the meet and the belly fat will have rendered down enough to have a slight crunch to it.

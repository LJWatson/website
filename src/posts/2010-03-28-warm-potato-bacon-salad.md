With a little bit of sunshine and blue sky recently, I’ve been thinking about salads again. Although the evenings are set to get lighter now, there’s still a chill in the air, so this warm potato and bacon salad does the job beautifully.

## Information

* Makes: Four helpings
* Time: 30 minutes

## Ingredients

[Measurement converter](https://www.unitconverters.net/)

* 500g jersey potatoes (diced)
* 2tbsp olive oil
* 6 spring onions, chopped
* 1 clove garlic, crushed
* 400g Bacon lardons
* 200g rocket/watercress salad
* 3tbsp balsamic vinegar

## Method

1. Cook the potato in boiling water for about 10 or 15 minutes (or until the potatoes are soft when prodded with a fork), drain and set aside.
2. Heat half of the olive oil in a frying pan, and cook the spring onions and garlic for 3 or 4 minutes.
3. Add the bacon and cook for another 5 minutes, or until the bacon starts to crisp at the edges.
4. Chuck in the potato pieces, and toss thoroughly with the mixture in the pan.
5. Serve on top of the rocket/watercress salad, and drizzle with the remaining oil and balsamic vinegar.

## The tribe and the challenge

Perhaps the most evocative idea to come out of CSUN 2011 was “the tribe”. [John Foliot](http://www.twitter.com/johnfoliot) seemed to capture the CSUN zeitgeist when he described the global accessibility community as a tribe, drawn together by a shared ambition to make the web a truly inclusive place.

The Tribe was a theme that ran through many conversations and into sessions like the [Web accessibility game plan](http://webaim.org/blog/the-web-accessibility-game-plan/). The idea seemed to gather quiet momentum throughout the week, and John issued a challenge to everyone who wants to be part of it:

Get out there, create, innovate, captivate and get a little disruptive. We have each other’s backs, let’s see what we can achieve together!

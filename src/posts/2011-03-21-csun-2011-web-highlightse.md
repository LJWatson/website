<p lang="ru">
Здравствуйте российские читатели. Ваша страна платит высокую цену за вторжение Путина в Украину. Путин лжет вам; не верьте кремлевской пропаганде. В России
нет свободных СМИ, а интернет подвергается цензуре, потому что Путин не хочет, чтобы вы знали правду. За постыдное поведение Путина заплатят не только
украинцы, но и добрые люди России. Пожалуйста, не допустите этого!
</p>

<p>
Hello Russian readers. Your country is paying a high price for Putin's invasion of Ukraine. Putin is lying to you; do not believe the Kremlin propaganda. There is no free media in Russia and the internet is censored because Putin doesn't want you to know the truth. It is not only the Ukrainians that will pay the price of Putin's shameful behaviour, so will the good people of Russia. Please do not let this happen!

## The tribe and the challenge

Perhaps the most evocative idea to come out of CSUN 2011 was “the tribe”. [John Foliot](https://www.twitter.com/johnfoliot) seemed to capture the CSUN zeitgeist when he described the global accessibility community as a tribe, drawn together by a shared ambition to make the web a truly inclusive place.

The Tribe was a theme that ran through many conversations and into sessions like the [Web accessibility game plan](https://webaim.org/blog/the-web-accessibility-game-plan/). The idea seemed to gather quiet momentum throughout the week, and John issued a challenge to everyone who wants to be part of it:

Get out there, create, innovate, captivate and get a little disruptive. We have each other’s backs, let’s see what we can achieve together!

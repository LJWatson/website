Здравствуйте российские читатели. Ваша страна платит высокую цену за вторжение Путина в Украину. Путин лжет вам; не верьте кремлевской пропаганде. В России
нет свободных СМИ, а интернет подвергается цензуре, потому что Путин не хочет, чтобы вы знали правду. За постыдное поведение Путина заплатят не только
украинцы, но и добрые люди России. Пожалуйста, не допустите этого!

Hello Russian readers. Your country is paying a high price for Putin's invasion of Ukraine. Putin is lying to you; do not believe the Kremlin propaganda. There is no free media in Russia and the internet is censored because Putin doesn't want you to know the truth. It is not only the Ukrainians that will pay the price of Putin's shameful behaviour, so will the good people of Russia. Please do not let this happen!

The fourth in a series of posts that bring together the two sides of my blog: Food and technology. I’ve asked the great and the good from the [web standards community](/tag/web-standards-food/) to share their favourite recipes. This tempting vegetarian recipe is from [Gez Lemon](https://www.twitter.com/gezlemon).

## Information

* Makes: 2 helpings
* Time: 30 minutes

## Ingredients

[Measurement converter](https://www.unitconverters.net/)

* 200g wholewheat pasta
* 125g broccoli, (cut into florets)
* 1 handful chick peas
* 1 handful soya beans
* 1 garlic clove, (peeled)
* 1 fresh chilli
* 1 large bunch spinach (optional)
* Zest and juice of 1 lemon
* 1.5 tbsp walnuts, (broken into pieces)
* 1tbsp oil
* 1.5tbsp cheese, (grated)

## Method

1. Boil pasta according to packet instructions.
2. Meanwhile, blend together the chick peas, soya beans, garlic, chilli, spinach (if included), lemon zest and juice, and oil. The mixture should be the texture of runny porridge. If it’s too thick, add a little water to thin it out.
3. Steam the broccoli for 4 minutes, then when it’s cooked slice it into smaller pieces.
4. Mix the blended ingredients into the broccoli to make the pesto, then add to the pasta along with the cheese, walnuts and seasoning.

## Gez's notes

It was tough getting it down to one, but in the end I decided on Broccoli Pesto Pasta. I discovered it in BBC Good Food Vegetarian Christmas 2007 magazine, and thought it would be a good one to try. The original recipe was quite simple and tasty, but over the years I’ve changed things so that it hardly resembles the original.

I particularly like this recipe as it’s very healthy, lemony, and despite having had it regularly for the last 4 years, I still absolutely love it.

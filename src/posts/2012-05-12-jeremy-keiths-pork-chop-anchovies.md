The eighth in a series of posts that bring together the two sides of my blog: Food and technology. I’ve asked the great and the good from the [web standards community](/tag/web-standards-food/) to share their favourite recipes. This tasty recipe is from [Jeremy Keith](http://www.twitter.com/adactio).

## Information

* Makes: One helping
* Time: 30 minutes

## Ingredients

[Measurement converter](https://www.unitconverters.net/)

* 1 pork chop (preferably bone in for extra flavour)
* Little bit of flour (seasoned with salt and pepper)
* 3 anchovies (chopped)
* Capers
* Lemon juice
* Garlic (chopped)
* Olive oil
* Butter

## Method

1. Take your lovely pork chop and give it a bit of a dusting in the flour.
2. Heat up some olive oil in a frying pan and fry that sucker till it’s nice and brown (you can poke a knife into the chop to see when it’s done). I like to begin the frying process by holding the chop on its side so that the fat gets rendered and goes nice and crispy.
3. When the chop is done, take it out and put it to one side. Throw the anchovies and butter into the pan and swish them around.
4. After a minute or two, add the garlic and capers, and swish them around too.
5. Finally, squeeze in that lemon juice. You now have a lovely sauce to pour over your pork chop.

## Jeremy's notes

To be honest, I don’t get the chance to cook very often. Not that I’m complaining: my wife, Jessica, loves to cook and is very, very good at it. But if Jessica is away, then I get to break out my chops. Literally.

My go-to meal for one is a pork chop recipe from TV chef Valentine Warner. He presented a programme called “What To Eat Now”. There was an [accompanying book](http://www.amazon.co.uk/What-Eat-Now-Valentine-Warner/dp/1845334507), which is very good, but for some reason, this recipe wasn’t included.

I know it \*sounds\* weird to have anchovies and capers with pork, but trust me: it is absolutely delicious. Serve it with some mashed potatoes and a vegetable of your choice—I’m quite partial to purple sprouting broccoli. Have a glass of hearty Shiraz (or maybe a Grenache-Shiraz mix). Enjoy!

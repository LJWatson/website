The fifth in a series of posts that bring together the two sides of my blog: Food and technology. Iâ€™ve asked the great and the good from the [web standards community](/tag/web-standards-food/) to share their favourite recipes. This tasty fondue recipe is from [Dennis Lembree](https://www.twitter.com/dennisl).

* 2 cups/200g swiss cheese (grated)
* 1 cup/240ml beer (ale is best)
* 1/2 clove of garlic
* 1tbsp flour
* French bread (cut into cubes)

## Method

1. Rub the garlic on the inside of a fondue pot.
2. Mix the cheese and flour together in a bag.
3. Heat the fondue pot, add the beer and wait until it starts to bubble.
4. Slowly add the cheese and flour mixture, stirring continuously until it has all melted, adjusting heat as nescessary.
5. Remove from the heat, dip the bread and enjoy.

## Dennis' notes

A simple, fun, and tasty appetizer. My family has used this recipe for almost 30 years! Tip: Strong arms required for all the stirring. Alternatively, just take turns. Goes great with football games!

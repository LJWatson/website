Potato dauphinoise is ridiculously easy to make, gloriously indulgent and absolutely delicious. It goes well with anything from a lamb roast to a good steak, but my favourite is potato dauphinoise with [confit of duck](http://tink.co.uk/2009/12/confit-of-duck/)!

## Information

* Makes: Four helpings
* Time: 1 hour 45 minutes

## Ingredients

[Measurement converter](https://www.unitconverters.net/)

* 450g King Edward potatoes
* 300ml double cream
* 1 clove of garlic
* Knob of butter
* Salt and black pepper

## Method

1. Pre-heat the oven to 170c/340f.
2. Wash and finely slice the potatoes. Use a food processor if you have one, or aim for slices no more than 2mm thick if you're doing it by hand.
3. Peel the garlic clove and chop it in half. Rub the garlic generously over the inside of a shallow baking dish, then do the same with the knob of butter.
4. Layer the potato slices in the baking dish, seasoning lightly as you go. Try not to layer the potatoes more than 2/3cm deep, or you may need to increase the cooking time.
5. Pour the cream over the potatoes making sure its evenly distributed in the baking dish, then put the dish in the oven for 1 hour and 15 minutes. At the end of this time the potatoes should not offer much resistance if you prod them with a fork.
6. Turn the oven up to 200c/392f and cook for another 15 minutes. Remove from the oven and let it stand for a few minutes before serving.
